Binary Search 

Validate a binary search tree. I did it using space O(1) (though I also suggested at first you can pop it in order to an array, then check the array-- which is more intuitive to understand but not space or time efficient). 
(I had a sentinel value that each node is checking against-- you can pass this into the function directly but I put it outside of the function for simplicity). Time efficiency for this is o(log2(n))
